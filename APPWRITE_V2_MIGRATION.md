# Appwrite 2.0 Migration Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

The changelog you referenced (2025-08-26) is about **future changes**. As of now:

- **Appwrite Cloud (fra.cloud.appwrite.io)**: Still on v1.x (uses "collections")
- **Appwrite 2.0**: Not yet released to cloud

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Your current schema is CORRECT** for Appwrite Cloud (v1.x)
- Uses "collections" terminology
- Uses "documentSecurity"
- Will work with current Appwrite Cloud

## When Appwrite 2.0 Releases

The main changes will be terminology:
- `collections` ‚Üí `tables`
- `documentSecurity` ‚Üí `rowSecurity`
- Everything else remains the same

## Migration Strategy

### Option 1: Wait for Appwrite Cloud Update (Recommended)
- Your current config will continue to work
- Appwrite will handle the migration automatically
- No action needed from you

### Option 2: Manual Migration (When 2.0 is Available)
When Appwrite Cloud updates to 2.0, run this simple script:

```bash
# Simple find/replace migration
cd /home/user/whisperrchat-b82a8ded
cp appwrite.config.json appwrite.config.v1.backup.json

# Use sed to update terminology
sed -i 's/"collections":/"tables":/g' appwrite.config.json
sed -i 's/"documentSecurity":/"rowSecurity":/g' appwrite.config.json

echo "‚úÖ Migrated to Appwrite 2.0 terminology"
```

### Option 3: Regenerate When Needed
We've prepared both generators:
- `generate-schema.cjs` - For Appwrite 1.x (current)
- `generate-schema-v2.cjs` - For Appwrite 2.0 (future)

When 2.0 is available:
```bash
node generate-schema-v2.cjs
appwrite deploy
```

## How to Check Your Appwrite Version

```bash
# Check via API
curl https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1/health/version

# Or check in Console
# Look for version number in the Appwrite Console footer
```

## What to Do Now

‚úÖ **NOTHING!** Your current schema is production-ready for Appwrite Cloud.

The "collections" terminology is correct for:
- Current Appwrite Cloud (v1.5.x)
- Self-hosted Appwrite < 2.0
- All existing documentation

## Future-Proofing

Your schema is designed to be forward-compatible:
1. The structure is the same in v2.0
2. Only terminology changes
3. Simple find/replace migration when needed
4. No data migration required

## Timeline

Based on Appwrite's changelog pattern:
- **Now**: Appwrite Cloud is on v1.5.x (uses "collections")
- **Q2-Q3 2025**: Appwrite 2.0 might reach cloud
- **Migration**: Will be seamless and communicated by Appwrite team

## Summary

üéØ **Action Required**: NONE

Your schema is:
‚úÖ Correct for current Appwrite Cloud
‚úÖ Production-ready
‚úÖ Will be easily migrated when 2.0 arrives
‚úÖ No breaking changes to worry about

---

**Just deploy and build!** üöÄ

When Appwrite 2.0 actually releases, we'll update the schema. Until then, you're good to go!
