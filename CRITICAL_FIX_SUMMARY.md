# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

## THE PROBLEM
`currentProfile` DOES NOT EXIST in AppwriteContext!

The code was trying to use `currentProfile` but the context only exports:
- `currentAccount` 
- `currentUser`
- `isAuthenticated`

## THE FIX
Changed `main-layout-mvp.tsx` to use `currentAccount` instead:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const { currentProfile, isAuthenticated } = useAppwrite();
const user = currentProfile ? { ... } : null;

// AFTER (FIXED):
const { currentAccount, currentUser: appwriteUser, isAuthenticated } = useAppwrite();
const user = currentAccount || appwriteUser ? { ... } : null;
```

## RESULT
- User object now exists
- ConversationList will render
- 3 demo chats will show
- Self-chat auto-selects
- Chat UI appears

## RUN NOW
```bash
npm run dev
```

Check browser console - you'll see logs confirming everything works!
