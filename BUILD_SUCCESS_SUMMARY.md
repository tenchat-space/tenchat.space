## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Main Appwrite Export
**File**: `src/lib/appwrite.ts`
- Updated to export new services (authService, userService, messagingService, etc.)
- Removed references to deprecated services (profileService, etc.)
- Added stub service exports (web3Service, socialService, realtimeService)

### 2. Rewrote Appwrite Context
**File**: `src/contexts/AppwriteContext.tsx`
- Simplified from complex profile management to basic user management
- Changed from `currentProfile` to `currentUser`
- Uses `userService` instead of deprecated `profileService`
- Removed complex Web3 wallet login flow (can be added later)
- Clean, minimal context for MVP

### 3. Created Stub Services
Services that are referenced but not yet implemented for MVP:

**web3.service.ts** - Web3 functionality stub
```typescript
- getUserWallets() - Returns empty array with console warning
```

**social.service.ts** - Social features stub
```typescript
- getUserStories() - Returns empty array with console warning
- getUserPosts() - Returns empty array with console warning
```

**realtime.service.ts** - Realtime subscriptions stub
```typescript
- subscribeToConversation() - Returns no-op unsubscribe function
```

These stubs allow the app to build while features are implemented incrementally.

### 4. Updated Service Exports
**File**: `src/lib/appwrite/services/index.ts`
- Added exports for all new services
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible

### 5. Fixed Import Errors
- Resolved all "not exported" errors
- Fixed all import/export mismatches
- Removed deprecated `TablesDB` references
- Updated to use modern `Databases` API

## Services Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- **AuthService** - Login, logout, registration, password recovery
- **UserService** - Get user, search users (from whisperrnote DB)
- **MessagingService** - Conversations, messages (from chat DB)
- **ContactsService** - Add, get, update, delete contacts
- **StorageService** - File uploads with bucket helpers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Stub Implementation (For Future Development)
- **Web3Service** - Wallets, NFTs, crypto transactions
- **SocialService** - Stories, posts, follows
- **RealtimeService** - Live updates, presence

## Database Architecture

### whisperrnote Database
- **users** collection - User management (shared with base app)

### chat Database
- **conversations** - Chat conversations
- **messages** - Chat messages
- **contacts** - User contacts
- **stories** - Social stories
- **posts** - Social posts
- ... and 14 more collections

## Environment Variables

### Required
```bash
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id  # Set this!
```

### Pre-configured
All database IDs, collection IDs, and bucket IDs are set in `env.sample`.

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Environment
```bash
cp env.sample .env
# Edit .env and add your VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Deploy
```bash
# Build is already done, just deploy dist/ folder
npm run build  # Already completed
# Upload dist/ to your hosting platform
```

### 4. Implement Stub Services (As Needed)
When you need these features:
- Implement Web3Service for wallet/crypto features
- Implement SocialService for stories/posts
- Implement RealtimeService for live updates

## TypeScript Status
